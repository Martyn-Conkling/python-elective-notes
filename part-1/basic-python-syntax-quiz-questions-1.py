# What are all of the basic data types in Python?



# In JavaScript we have a "null" data type which can be used when we want an empty placeholder value that isn't any other data type.
# What is the python equivalent of JavaScript's "null"?


# How do you write code blocks in Python?


# How do you write loops in Pyhon?
# Write a for loop that iterates over an array of names, and prints them out

# How do you write functions in Python?
# Write a function that can check to see if a string is a pallendrome (the same spelled forward and backward)




# Question 1: Variables and Data Types
# Write a Python program that declares two variables: a with value 10 and b with value 20. Then, print the result of adding a and b.

# Question 2: Conditional Statements
# Write a Python program that checks if a variable x is greater than 10. If x is greater than 10, print "x is greater than 10". Otherwise, print "x is 10 or less".

# Question 3: Loops
# Write a Python program that uses a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers (for example, numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and prints each number squared (i.e., multiplied by itself).

# Question 4: Functions
# Write a Python function named multiply that takes two parameters and returns their product. Then, call this function with the arguments 5 and 3, and print the result.

# Question 5: String Manipulation
# Write a Python program that takes a string variable name containing the value "John Doe" and prints the following sentence using string formatting: "Hello, John Doe! Welcome to Python programming."
